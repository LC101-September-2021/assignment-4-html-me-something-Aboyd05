        <h2>Rome</h2>

        <p class="funParagraph" id="testP">My first time to Europe I visted Rome. I enjoyed the food and learned about the Roman empire. The coloseum was a site to see and I spent the whole day taking pictures. 
         The first ever shopping mall was built in Rome between 107 and 110 AD by Emperor Trajan. It sold a wide variety of goods and grocery items.</p>

        <h2>Portland, Oregon</h2>
        <img src = "\images\portlandthingsc.jpg" width="800" height="600">
        <p>Portland was a surprise to me, I was expecting lots of rain and clouds but the weather was quite nice when I visted. Portland is a craft beer mecca and I spent most of my time visting local breweries and took a tour of a hop farm. The people were friendly and the seafood was amazing.</p>

         <h2>Phoenix, Arizona</h2>
         <img src = "\images\phoenix-skyline-cactus-getty-20211027.jpg" width="800" height="600">
         <p>I could see myself moving to Phoenix later in life. I prefer the warmer climate and most days it is sunny. The Phoenix botanical garden is a must do while visting. The Garden presents Spring and Fall open-air acoustic concert series, art exhibitions, and Las Noches de las Luminarias since 1978. The Luminarias Festival became a Southwestern Holiday tradition featuring live music by the flickering lights of 8000 hand-lit lamps.</p>
